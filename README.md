**Discord+** is a theme for [Discord](https://discord.com). It's both sleek and customizable, without getting in your way. Its top priority is balancing between looks and performance.

## User customization

This theme is **very customizable**.
The variables in the theme file allow you to change many things, including but not limited to:

* Background image
* Accent color
* Up to three fonts
* Home icon
* Background cover colors
* UI corner roundness
* Overall spacing

If customizing the theme is difficult, [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/2Jwh2nS) has a detailed FAQ with answers to common questions! If that still doesn't solve your problem, someone may volunteer to help you in the #get-help channel.
